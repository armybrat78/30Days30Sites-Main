## What is #30Days30Sites
The only way to get better at building websites is, well, by building websites!

Every day for 30 days you will receive a prompt via email containing a topic for a new website.  From there, how you build your website is 100% up to you.

There will also be links to resources included each day that may be helpful on your journey.

## Rules *("more like guidelines than actual rules")*

* Commit to working daily on your site
* Feel free to share your progress on social media with #30Days30Sites
* Join the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/30days30sites) to help each other improve
* Fill out a [daily log](https://github.com/Staxed/30Days30Sites-Main/blob/master/log.md) to help you keep track of what you are learning

## The Log

It has been proven that writing things down helps to retain memories and learned skills.  It's also fun to go back and read your old logs to see how far you have progressed.

The [log.md](https://github.com/Staxed/30Days30Sites-Main/blob/master/log.md) file in this repository is there for you to edit and add a short *(or long...it's up to you)* note about what you learned or accomplished each day.  You don't have to share it with anyone if you don't want.  You really don't even HAVE to do it...but if you are serious about learning and retaining knowledge, it is a simple and quick thing to do each day.

## **FAQ:**

### **I don't know how to code!**
It's ok.  There is no better way to learn than by doing.  The emails you receive will contain resources and tutorials that should give you some pointers.  You can also join the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/30days30sites) and ask questions and get advice.

### **Where can I learn?**
While this challenge provides prompts and a link to a new resource each day, we know that there are many more resources out there.  We can't provide a link to every single one since we don't know about them.  But the ones that we do know about and can recommend are listed in the resources.md file of this repository.

*If you find anything you find useful on your journey, please feel free to submit a pull request or contact me (info at bottom) to get new resources added here.*

### **What if I miss a day?**
That's ok too, it happens.  The key here is to remember why you are doing this.  You didn't join this challenge for anyone other than YOU.  Keep yourself accountable by getting right back on track.  Don't feel pressured to do two days tomorrow, just continue on as scheduled.

You can skip the day you missed completely, or tack it on to the end.  The end result is you learning something new and building your portfolio up through this challenge.  Just focus on that!

### **Where can I host my code?**
You can host your code whereever you want, but we recommend either Github or Codepen.

With Codepen, it is a self contained coding area where you can writing your code and view the results through the same browser application.  It's simple to use and simple to share with others when you are done.

If you want a more personalized solution you can opt for Github.  Either create your own portfolio repository *(and we'd suggest setting up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with it!)* or use this one (after you have forked it of course).

We recommend making a new folder for each day, but since it's your challenge...you do it how you want!
